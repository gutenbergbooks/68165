  <h2 class='c008'>ANTE-MORTEM HISTORY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Chang and Eng Bunker</span> were born near Bangkok,
Siam, in 1811, their father being a Chinaman, their
mother a native of Siam, bred by a Chinese <span class="nowrap">father.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class='c011'>The twins were united by a band extending from
the junction of the abdominal and thoracic cavities,
anteriorly, constituting the variety in teratology known
as <i>Omphalopagus xiphodidymus</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were married in April, 1843, and raised large
families; Chang having had ten, and Eng twelve children.
Chang had three boys and seven girls; Eng
had seven boys and five girls. These were in all respects
average children, excepting two, a boy and girl
of Chang’s, who were deaf-mutes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The twins resided in a rolling country, about four
miles from Mount Airy, Surrey Co., N. C. They were
prosperous farmers, each owning his own farm. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>dwellings of the two families were a mile and a half
apart. The twins resided three days in each of the
homes alternately. They were expert in the handling
of tools, in plowing, shingling, shooting, etc. They
lived much in the open air, and frequently drove in a
carriage to the neighboring village.</p>

<p class='c011'>The events leading to their death were as follows:
About six years ago Chang, who had always been the
more excitable, became addicted to immoderate drinking.
Three years ago, while on a voyage from Liverpool
to New York, he was stricken with hemiplegia of
the right side. He in great measure recovered from
this attack, but could never ascend and descend stairs
with facility. For this reason the twins occupied rooms
on the ground floors of their homes.</p>

<p class='c011'>On Monday evening, Jan. 12th, 1874, Chang was
seized, while at his own house, with an attack of bronchitis.
He had a cough; scanty, frothy sputa; but no
pain. On Wednesday the symptoms had somewhat
subsided; the skin was acting freely. Loud bronchial
râles were present over the left side of the chest. On
Thursday evening the twins insisted upon leaving
Chang’s house for Eng’s. The weather was very cold,
and the journey was undertaken in an open carriage.
On their arrival, however, Chang continued as well as
before, until Friday evening, when he complained of thoracic
oppression and inability to lie down with comfort.
After having retired that evening, the twins were heard
to get up, and go out on the porch, by the side of the
house, where they drank of water, and returned to their
room. They built a large wood fire, and sat down; Eng
soon complaining of being sleepy, Chang declaring
that he could not breathe if he should lie down. Finally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>they again retired. They both fell asleep. Near daybreak
(Jan. 17th) Eng called to one of his sons, who
slept in a room above, to come down and waken Chang.
The boy soon made his appearance, and going to the
side of Chang, cried out, “Uncle Chang is dead!”
Eng at once said “Then I am going!”—It is probable
that Chang was sleeping when he died.</p>

<p class='c011'>Eng made no further mention of Chang other than
to request that the body be moved closer to him. Soon
afterward Eng desired to have his limbs moved. This
desire continued for half an hour. He then asked for
a urinal, but did not void over a few drops of urine.
He several times repeated the endeavor to micturate,
but without success. He then complained of a choking
sensation, and asked to be raised in bed. He had
continued rational. His last words were “May God
have mercy on my soul!” He gradually became
fainter, fell into a syncopal state, and died quietly a
little over two hours from the announcement to him of
the death of his brother.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>AUTOPSY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>Autopsy</span> was begun in the house of Eng, Sunday,
February 1st, 1874, and finished in the Mütter
Museum of the College of Physicians, at Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='c011'>Age of subjects, 63 years. Examination made about
fifteen days and eight hours after death. The weather
had been cold. No preservative had been employed
prior to the date of the autopsy.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>I. <span class='sc'>Post-mortem Appearances.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The following is their description in Chang.</p>

<p class='c011'>Body moderately emaciated. <i>Rigor mortis</i> none.
The fingers of the right hand were semi-flexed, a condition
due doubtless to the long-standing paralysis of
the right upper extremity. Passive congestion was
marked over entire dorsal aspect of the neck, trunk,
and upper extremities. It was less marked over the
corresponding surfaces of the forearm and legs. The
feet and hands were almost entirely free. The superficial
veins in the last-named localities, especially in
the left foot, were distended. The passive congestion
extended over the right thoracic region as far as the
median line, and on the front of both thighs, especially
the right. Upon the head the congestion was seen
behind and beneath the ears, and was sparsely distributed
over both malar prominences. The lips were
discolored. The integument of the genitals was infiltrated,
the scrotum particularly being much swollen.
There was extensive greenish discoloration on the anterior
abdominal wall. The left external abdominal
ring was enlarged. Both testicles were within the
scrotum. The hair of the head was gray. That on
the right side of the pubis was black, that on the left
was of an iron-gray color.</p>

<p class='c011'>The following is their description in Eng.</p>

<p class='c011'>Body moderately well nourished, spare. <i>Rigor mortis</i>
slight. Passive congestion less marked than in
Chang. It was most conspicuous on the buttocks and
infraspinous spaces. There was none in front of the
body. The testicle of left side absent from scrotum.
There was moderate greenish discoloration of anterior
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>wall of abdomen. The hair on the pubis was black on
the right side, pure gray on left side of the median line.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Measurements.</i>—Chang was 5 ft. <span class="nowrap">2-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> in.</span> in height;
Eng, 5 ft. <span class="nowrap">3-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> in.</span> When the bodies were laid upon a
table Chang’s left side and Eng’s right side were drawn
somewhat toward one another. This was most marked
in Chang, and gave a greater inclination of his trunk
toward his brother’s. (See Figs. <a href='#fig1'>1</a> and <a href='#fig19'>19</a>.)</p>

<h3 class='c012'>II. <span class='sc'>External Appearances of the Band.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>When the bodies were suspended and placed face to
face, it was evident that the congenital position had
been secured. All observations were made, as far as
was possible, with the bodies in this position. With it
the details of structure, it was thought, could be easily
understood; without it the subject would be difficult
and confused.</p>

<p class='c011'>The “band” was a massive commissure placed between
the bodies at the junction of the abdominal and
thoracic regions of each. It was broader above than
below, and had a circumference of nine inches. It
presented four surfaces for examination, an upper,
lower, and two lateral surfaces.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>upper</i> surface was somewhat flattened in both
Chang and Eng. The ensiform cartilage of each
body could be felt deflected from the sternum and
prolonged into the band. The base of the cartilage
in Eng presented a rounded circular eminence, measuring
one inch in diameter. There was no corresponding
eminence in Chang. The upper aspect of
each process could be well defined beneath the skin,
the subcutaneous connective tissue being more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>abundant in Chang than in Eng. The upper surface measured
<span class="nowrap">2-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> in.</span> in width at its base towards Eng, and <span class="nowrap">2-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span>
in. at its base towards Chang. It was 2 in. wide at its
middle.</p>

    death at Philadelphia.
    </dd>
    </dl>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The <i>lower</i> surface was much narrower than the upper.
It was marked in the centre, but nearer the anterior than
the posterior border, by a linear scar one inch in length,
which it was thought answered to the position of the
single umbilicus. The skin was adherent at this point,
but elsewhere was easily raised in folds. Behind the
scar, <i>i. e.</i>, toward the posterior part of the band, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>skin was somewhat corrugated. This portion answered,
in position, to Chang’s umbilical pouch.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>lateral</i> surfaces. The terms <i>upper</i> surface and
<i>lower</i> surface have fixed values, no matter how they
may be approached by the observer. This is not the
case, however, with the lateral surfaces, as will appear
from the following considerations. Viewing the band
as a separate form—as it was spoken of during the life
of the twins—we will see that the terms front (“anterior”)
and back (“posterior”), as given to the lateral
surfaces, were derived from studying the acquired
position. Thus we were bound not to cut the “front”
of the band, but allowed to make an incision on the
“back.” Now this position of selection was destroyed,
and its terms deprived of what meaning they may have
had, by the reproduction of the congenital relations of
the bodies.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is no doubt that in infancy and early childhood
there was no acquired position, and, therefore,
neither “front” nor “back” to the band. And later,
when, as we have reason to believe, the position of selection
was gradually adopted, the terms “front” and
“back” were reversible—the “front” meaning that
which corresponded to the surface of least thoracic
approximation. Thus when the adult condition was
fixed, and the “front” answered to the widely separated
right side of Eng’s chest and left side of Chang’s
chest, the “back” was in relation with the closely approximated
left side of Eng’s chest and right side of
Chang’s.</p>

<p class='c011'>To avoid awkward repetition of phrases expressing
the facts of the last sentence, the following characters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>will be employed in describing the “lateral” surfaces of
the band.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class="nowrap">E. R.</span>, <span class="nowrap">C. L.</span> (Eng’s right, Chang’s left) will designate
the “anterior” surface of the acquired position.
<span class="nowrap">C. R.</span>, <span class="nowrap">E. L.</span> (Chang’s right, Eng’s left) will designate
the “posterior” surface. Since the right side of
Chang’s half of the band merged into the left on Eng’s
half, while the right side of Eng’s half, after it passed
the middle line, became the left half of Chang’s, we
propose using the characters <span class="nowrap">E. L.</span>, <span class="nowrap">E. R.</span>, and <span class="nowrap">C. R.</span>,
<span class="nowrap">C. L.</span>, which will be understood as signifying left side
Eng, right side Eng, etc.</p>

<p class='c011'>Using the above signs we found that the surface
<span class="nowrap">E. R.</span>, <span class="nowrap">C. L.</span> was inclined decidedly downward and
backward when seen in the congenital position, and was
3 in. high and <span class="nowrap">2-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> in.</span> wide. At <span class="nowrap">E. R.</span>, the border answering
to the ensiform cartilage was marked by a large
rounded tubercle; it was much more pronounced than
on the corresponding border of <span class="nowrap">C. L.</span> When seen in
the acquired position, <span class="nowrap">E. R.</span>, <span class="nowrap">C. L.</span> became “anterior,”
when, at its upper margin, <span class="nowrap">C. L.</span> was longer than <span class="nowrap">E. R.</span>
by one-half inch. The tubercle on <span class="nowrap">E. R.</span>, already
noticed, was much more prominent than <span class="nowrap">C. L.</span> The
contour of the inferior margin was also different, being
more uneven. <span class="nowrap">C. L.</span> was not only longer, but was
more obliquely placed downward and outward to the
centre of the band than <span class="nowrap">E. R.</span> (See cast in the Mütter
Museum.)</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Turning the skin flaps here indicated upwards and
downwards, and the lateral triangles outwards, there
was found beneath, a layer of superficial fatty connective
tissue, with a well-defined layer of fat on either
side, but with an intermediate portion which was free
from fat, and of greater thickness.</p>

<p class='c011'>The skin could with some little trouble be raised
over the <i>dorsal or upper surface</i>, showing here entire
absence of fat. A very delicate artery was found
running across the middle, from Eng to Chang.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lower portion of the surface <span class="nowrap">C. R.,</span> <span class="nowrap">E. L.</span> was
inseparably connected with the umbilicus. It was
also united to the superficial fascia on <span class="nowrap">C. L.,</span> about <span class="nowrap">1-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>
inches from the umbilicus; this did not have any connection
with the deeper parts. The process of fibrous
tissue which had been felt through the skin was conspicuous
on this surface of the band, and was covered
by a delicate non-fatty layer of connective tissue.
Towards the lower part of the surface were seen
several diverging lines of fibrous tissue, which were
lost within the integument about the umbilical scar, at
the lower surface of the band. They were exceedingly
thin, and at one point lay directly over the posterior
and inferior wall of the umbilical pouch of Chang.</p>

<p class='c011'>Turning down the superficial layer, the aponeurosis
of the external oblique muscle was exposed (Fig. <a href='#fig3'>3</a>).
A marked contrast was exhibited in the two sides of
the band. In Chang the parts were normal so far as
they were exposed—the characteristic apertures for
the escape of small vessels being abundant and conspicuous.
In turning down the superficial fascia in
Eng (Fig. <a href='#fig3'>3</a>, <span class='fss'>A</span>), it was found to be continuous at its
lower portion with an aponeurotic layer (Fig. <a href='#fig3'>3</a>, <span class='fss'>B</span>),
which extended toward the median line, where it was
continuous with the linea alba of Chang. In addition
to this, a second layer (Fig. <a href='#fig3'>3</a>, <span class='fss'>C</span>), analogous in position
to a deep layer of the superficial fascia, which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>entirely independent of Chang, extended over nearly
the whole of Eng’s division, and was particularly well
defined over the fibres of origin of the external oblique
muscle. This was continuous with the deep layer of
the superficial fascia which passed over the entire side
of Eng’s thorax.</p>

<p class='c011'>Toward the middle of the band this layer gradually
lost its distinctive features, and was firmly incorporated
with the tendon of the external oblique muscle. A
number of fibres corresponding to it extended in
inseparable intimacy with this tendon. These were
gradually lost as they approached the linea alba of
Chang, and the parts being in position these fibres
were at their lower portion covered in by the aponeurotic
extension of the linea alba already mentioned.</p>

<p class='c011'>On Chang’s side, as we have seen, the parts comparable
to these accessory layers were absent. There
was no line of demarcation between the tendon of
the oblique and the aponeurotic attachment of the
pectoralis. The tendon of the external oblique presented
a different appearance from the normal one in a
more extensive interlacing of fibres of the linea alba
with the tendon.</p>

<p class='c011'>The part termed above the linea alba of Chang
(Fig. <a href='#fig3'>3</a>, <span class='fss'>E</span>), has already been indicated through skin
and superficial fascia. As can be seen, this band of
fibres, having its origin from the middle line of the
abdomen of Chang, was found to be a direct continuation
of the linea alba. It was remarkable in not being
inserted into the ensiform process of Chang, but into
that of Eng, and in giving off the aponeurotic outshoot
<span class='fss'>B</span>, already noticed, as well as in having a diffused point
of insertion into Eng’s tissue as in the ensiform
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>cartilage (<span class='fss'>F</span>). In a word, the linea alba approaches the
surface <span class="nowrap">C. R.,</span> <span class="nowrap">E. L.</span> from <span class="nowrap">C. R.</span> below, and is inserted
into <span class="nowrap">E. L.</span> above.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>IV. <span class='sc'>Organs Of Abdomen as observed in position through the Incisions.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>Limited incisions being alone permitted, the large
vessels of the abdomen were sought for in the process
of embalmment, believing, as we did, that the procedures
of securing them would enable us, by extending
the cuts from below upward, to fairly open the
abdomen and examine thereby the interior of the band.</p>

<p class='c011'>In each body, therefore, an incision six inches long
(Fig. <a href='#fig2'>2</a>, <i>ab</i>, <i>cd</i>) was extended from the centre of
the right iliac region to the centre of the right hypochondriac
region. This was subsequently joined
by an oblique incision passing from the upper end of
the first mentioned to the lateral border of the ensiform
cartilage at its base. This incision measured
<span class="nowrap">7-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> in.</span> The lower end of the vertical incision was met
by a horizontal one passing to the centre of the hypogastric
region, and measuring <span class="nowrap">3-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> in.</span></p>

<p class='c009'>Through these incisions were studied (1) the <i>umbilical
ligaments</i> and (2) <i>the abdominal viscera</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>1. <i>The umbilical ligaments.</i><a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a>—By turning forward
the anterior flap in Eng as far as possible, the peritoneal
lining was exhibited, and there was brought into
view a structure beginning at the summit of the
bladder, and which, ascending the abdominal wall and
passing obliquely to the right side, could be traced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>clearly to the scar-like tissue marking the remains of
the umbilical structures situated upon the anterior
abdominal wall within about <span class="nowrap">1-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> in.</span> of the band. This
structure was the umbilical ligament (Fig. <a href='#fig4'>4</a>, <span class='fss'>A</span>). It
was loaded with fat, and, as it terminated at the scar,
distinct lobules of fat (several of which were pedunculated)
were abundantly deposited.</p>

<p class='c011'>The bladder was distended and raised 5 in. above
the pubis.</p>

<p class='c011'>In Chang (Fig. <a href='#fig5'>5</a>), the same appearances were seen
as those above given, save that no fat was deposited
in the umbilical ligament. On the contrary, it resembled
the omentum of an emaciated subject. When
stretched, the fold was fully an inch wide, quite transparent,
and marked by two longitudinal bands, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>recalled the shapes of the obliterated vessels. But two
rather small sessile fatty appendages were seen at the
scar.</p>

<p class='c011'>The bladder was empty, contracted, and lay within
the true pelvis.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>across the abdomen, beginning on the right side on a
level with the eleventh rib. It was contracted and
contained a little flatus. The rest of the exposed
region was occupied by coils of small intestine, yielding
a mesentery very rich in fat. The stomach was
not visible. By removing the small intestine, and
bringing down the transverse colon and large intestine,
the pyloric extremity of the stomach was seen. The
fundus of stomach, spleen, and left kidney were not
seen. (Fig. <a href='#fig6'>6</a>.)</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span><i>The liver.</i>—The right lobe was alone visible. This
extended entirely across the right hypochondriac and
epigastric regions. Its external free border was not in
contact with the ribs. Between it and the external
abdominal wall there was an interval of nearly an inch
at its greatest part, which was crossed by the external
lateral ligament. The inferior border of the lobe rested
upon and nearly concealed the pylorus of the stomach
as well as the upper half of right kidney. Corresponding
in position to the upper portion of the right
kidney was a well-defined layer of peritoneum, presenting
a sharply defined internal border. Upon dissecting
away the peritoneum from this border it was
found to answer to the inferior vena cava. The lesser
omentum occupied its usual position. The fundus of
the gall-bladder was two-thirds of an inch beyond the
anterior border of the lobe, immediately to the outer side
of the caudal lobe. The position of the longitudinal
fissure was well off to the left side of the abdomen,
presenting, between the right and left lobes, a conspicuous
cleft which was partially occupied by the base of
the caudal lobe. The round ligament, with its associated
suspensory ligament, had doubtless passed
nearly vertically, before the relations had been disturbed
by the incision in the abdominal wall, upwards
and forwards to the anterior abdominal wall at a point
lying one inch to the outer side of the centre of the
umbilicus.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the subject, as it lay on the table with the flap
<i>a, b</i> (Fig. <a href='#fig2'>2</a>), turned to the left, the suspensory ligament
had the appearance of being much more obliquely
inclined to the left, and could be made nearly
horizontal by a little traction. Lying beneath this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>ligament, but belonging to the anterior abdominal
wall, was a large mass of subperitoneal fat about the
size of a pigeon’s egg. Extending to the extreme left,
and continuous with the anterior border of the left
lobe of the liver, was a delicate prolongation of liver
substance which was lost within the connecting band.</p>

<p class='c011'>The upper surface of this prolongation was supported
by a fold of peritoneum, extending directly upward,
apparently attached to the base of the ensiform
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>cartilage. Visible upon the anterior aspect of this fold
was a tortuous artery, afterwards found to be the left
internal mammary. This fold may be called <i>the accessory
suspensory ligament</i>; nothing similar to it was
seen in Chang. The left lobe of the liver, save a portion
of its anterior edge, was not visible.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Chang (Fig. <a href='#fig7'>7</a>), by exposing the parts as in Eng,
throwing the abdominal flap, <i>c, d</i> (Fig. <a href='#fig2'>2</a>), to the right,
there was at once brought into view the transverse
colon, the greater omentum, and greater curvature of
the stomach. The latter organ was large, empty, and
without any undue traction could be so displayed as to
yield its fundus and greater curvature in position. The
fundus was not visible. Lying conspicuously within
the left hypochondriac region was the spleen. Its inferior
free border, with its peritoneal attachment, was
distinctly seen; its upper portions, however, were invisible.
The left lobe of the liver held a position answering
to that of the right lobe in Eng—the external
lateral ligament being stretched across the left hypochondriac
region, pursuing a similar course to the external
lateral ligament of Eng (<i>q. v.</i>). The left lobe at
its outer portion rested upon the spleen, its inner portion
upon the stomach. The outer portion of the left
lobe presented a thin compressed border, the inner portion
was divided by a deep sulcus into two lobes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The right lobe lay deep within the right hypochondriac
region, the portion about the longitudinal fissure
anteriorly, alone appearing in the dissection. The suspensory
ligament held a position similar to that in Eng.
The gall-bladder held its normal position to the right
lobe, and was moderately distended with bile.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Both Chang and Eng had the organs occupying the
hypochondriac and epigastric regions retaining, on the
whole, such relations as are usually observed.</p>

<p class='c011'>This statement appears pertinent, at this stage of
the autopsy, in order to explain—</p>

<h3 class='c012'>V. <span class='sc'>Interior of Band.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>We here describe (1) <i>the hepatic pouches</i>; (2) <i>the
umbilical pouches</i>; (3) <i>the vascular structures of the
band</i>; (4) <i>the diaphragms</i>; (5) <i>the ensiform cartilages</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>1. <i>The hepatic pouches.</i>—The photograph (Fig. <a href='#fig2'>2</a>)
indicates the position of the right lobe of Eng’s liver in
the right hypochondriac region. The right lobe of
Chang is of course not seen in the figure, since it lies
on the side of the body which is not in the field of vision.
It must follow from the rights and lefts of the two individuals
being opposites that, in drawing a line between
the livers (which, as already seen, occupy normal
positions as to right and left) across the band, such
a line will be diagonal to the axes of the ensiform cartilages;
Chang’s half of the band having the line enter
the band from his “right,” Eng from his “left.” It will
also follow that any pouches of peritoneum which might
accompany this line will pursue a similar direction—be
on the same plane—be right or left with respect to
the axis of that plane. Now it was actually demonstrated
that such a line did extend between the livers,
and was accompanied by such peritoneal pouches.
These pouches were termed the hepatic pouches, and
may be described as follows:—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Chang.</span>—The subject lying on the table with rights
and lefts determined as in the acquired position, the
finger could be inserted behind the suspensory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>ligament (Fig. <a href='#fig7'>7</a>) in a pouch lying directly beneath the
ensiform cartilages, into which passed an extension of
liver-like tissue.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Eng.</span>—This fact could not be well demonstrated in
Eng in this position, but is well seen in Fig. <a href='#fig8'>8</a>.</p>

<p class='c011'>It follows that the two hepatic pouches are on nearly
the same plane, and that each approaches the central
point of the band diagonally from the right side of the
subject with whose abdominal cavity it is continuous.</p>

<p class='c013'>2. <i>The umbilical pouches.</i>—Beneath the hepatic
pouches, and between them and the inferior border of
the band, were two pouches which, from their association
with the round ligament, have been termed <i>the umbilical
pouches</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the finger was passed toward the band from
the abdomen of Chang, and following the peritoneum
of the anterior wall of the abdomen, it passed into a
pouch of the band directly over the skin covering,
across the band, over the umbilicus, and was received
within the folds of the suspensory ligament of the
liver of Eng. This pouch was so superficial that while
the finger was in the pouch any motion of the finger
was readily followed by the observer.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the same way as above, if the finger was introduced
<i>behind</i> the suspensory ligament of Eng, it slipped
into a pouch which passed across the median line of
the band, and was received within the folds of the suspensory
ligament of the liver of Chang.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were then two pouches communicating with
the two abdominal cavities, arranged one above another
in the band, Chang’s being the lower of the two. No
remains of an umbilical vein were detected, nor was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>there any communication between the pouches and the
umbilicus. It has already been noticed that the round
ligament of each liver passed from the longitudinal
fissure to a scar on the anterior wall of the abdomen
near the band. It was not, therefore, within the round
ligaments, but the folds of the suspensory ligaments,
that the pouches were found.</p>

<p class='c011'>Eng’s pouch measured <span class="nowrap">2-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> in.</span> From edge of Chang’s
suspensory ligament to end of hepatic pouch measured
3 in.</p>

<p class='c011'>Extending across the band, about midway between
the properties of the two individuals, was a septum.
It was attached above and below to the respective
boundaries of the band, and along its entire length
was incorporated with its two peritoneal cavities, so
that when in the course of the dissection of the “posterior”
surface of the band the peritoneal covering of
the band was displayed, several large lobules of fat
were seen lying to Eng’s side of the <span class="nowrap">septum.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a></span></p>

<p class='c011'>It will be seen that Fig. <a href='#fig8'>8</a> represents the band opened
to display the pouches with the septum. The lower
end of the septum is fixed near the scar of the umbilicus,
and holds an immobile position over the umbilical
pouches. At this point it is free from fat. But as
it extends over the hepatic pouches it is more pliant.
This portion of the septum has been carried a little to
Chang’s side of the band to display the entire length
of the hepatic pouch of Eng.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Figs. <a href='#fig9'>9</a> and <a href='#fig10'>10</a> are designed to exhibit the appearances

three inches in length, was compressed, and measured
six lines wide and three lines thick. The tract arose
from the livers at the same point—namely, directly
above the longitudinal fissure, having more fulness on
the side of the right than of the left lobe. The round
ligament, as it passed out of the longitudinal fissure of
each liver, was placed beneath and a little to the left
of the tract.</p>

<p class='c011'>3. <i>The vascular structures of the band</i> were as follows:—</p>

<p class='c011'>The livers being united, it was found that a colored
injection thrown into the portal vein of Chang passed
into the liver of Eng. A careful dissection of the
<a id='corr26.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='original: bloodvessel'>blood vessel</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_26.4'>blood vessel</a></span> (Fig. <a href='#fig11'>11</a>, <span class='fss'>C</span>) proved it to be a terminal twig
of the portal system of Chang. It was of the thickness
of a No. seven catheter, French scale, gradually
diminished in size, and was lost toward the centre of
the band. It did not pass as such across the band,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>but appeared to break up into minute branches before
reaching the liver of Eng. At the same time there
was undoubted distension of the portal capillaries
with the colored fluid under the capsule of the dorsal
surface of the right lobe of Eng’s liver, one and
one-half inches from the band. Examination of the
branches of the mesenteric veins of Eng revealed the
curious fact that some of them had received the injection.
This had not been transmitted through the
liver, for the portal vein at the transverse fissure was
empty, but through a distinct extra-hepatic portal
track, which was found lying under the peritoneum
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>beneath the position of the hepatic pouches, and in
association with the umbilical pouches. This vessel
began by relatively large radicals towards Chang’s side,
became larger as these encroached on Eng’s side, and
was finally received within the portal system of Eng’s
body, as a tributary to its mesenteric vein.</p>

of fibres (<span class='fss'>C</span>) belonging entirely to Eng. A second
arrangement of fibres was seen above those just indicated,

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>5. <i>The ensiform cartilages.</i>—After removing the
diaphragms the cartilages were exposed. They may
be described as follows:—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Chang.</span>—The cartilage measured <span class="nowrap">2-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> in.</span> wide, and
8 in. in length along its axis. The right border was
very prominent, and projected <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> in. beyond the limit of
the corresponding border in Eng. It was almost in
close contact with the cartilage of the eighth rib; it was
very robust, with upper surface convex, under surface
nearly plane. The left lateral border was <span class="nowrap">2-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> in.</span> in
length, right lateral border 11 lines in length. The
former was marked by three tubercles of about equal
size. One situated about 1 in. from the sternal origin;
the other about 2 in. from the same point; the third
at its extreme anterior border. None of these were
robust, or presented any of the thickening noticed on
the right side. The middle of these tubercles was on
a line with that of the posterior tubercle. The junction
of the ensiform process with the sternum was not
marked by the eminence characterizing the similar
point in Eng.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Eng.</span>—The cartilage differed from that of Chang in
being <span class="nowrap">2-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> in.</span> wide, 11 lines in length of axis. The
left lateral border was abruptly deflected downward,
and did not present the transverse smooth projection
noticed in Chang. This deflection was almost at right
angles to the dorsal surface, acuminate inferiorly, and
presenting a straight surface toward Chang, and an
oblique one toward the ribs. The length of left lateral
border was 1 in. The right lateral border, <span class="nowrap">1-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> in.</span> in
length, presented a smooth sub-rounded edge without
tubercles, and terminated in a free rounded border on
a plane a little above that of Chang. On the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>this border was more robust than that of Chang. On
the dorsal aspect of the process near its base was seen
the rounded eminence described in the account of the
external appearances (see page 7).</p>

<p class='c011'>A comparison between the two ensiform cartilages
shows that in Chang the anterior border was longer
than in the right in Eng. In other proportions Eng’s
was equal if not larger than Chang’s, and was more
robust.</p>

<p class='c011'>The union between the cartilages was of the character
of a symphysis. The union was very intimate
along the border <span class="nowrap">E. L.,</span> <span class="nowrap">C. R.,</span> “posterior” (Fig. <a href='#fig14'>14</a>); the
exposure of the junction by a delicate transverse cut
showed a close union between the cartilages, thus constituting
this part of the band a synchondrosis. That
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>this, however, did not characterize the entire line of
apposition was at once seen by turning to the border
<span class="nowrap">E. R.,</span> <span class="nowrap">C. L.</span> (“anterior”), where an interval, two lines
in width, was seen between the cartilages, an interval
which had been evidently susceptible of variation
during life. This interval extended across one-fourth
the width of the band. The portion of the band
between the parts as above indicated, was occupied by
a bursa-like sac (Fig. <a href='#fig14'>14</a>, <span class='fss'>D</span>), which was opened by a
minute orifice (<span class='fss'>E</span>) to display its true nature. This sac
was crossed above by a stout band of fibrous tissue
(Fig. <a href='#fig15'>15</a>, <span class='fss'>A</span>) an inch in width. Beneath, the sac was
protected by a less well-defined band of the same
width as the upper ligament, and which crossed between
the two processes, to be lost in the perichondrium.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>VI. <span class='sc'>Other Structures.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>1. <i>The spleens.</i>—This organ in Eng was 5 in. long,
<span class="nowrap">3-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> in.</span> wide. The dorsum was marked by a large
sulcus, extending nearly across the organ, continuous
with the sulcus on the superior border. The hilus was
relatively shorter than that of Chang, beginning
above, fully an inch below its upper border, and terminating
within a half inch of its inferior border.</p>

<p class='c011'>In Chang it measured 5 in. long, <span class="nowrap">2-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> in.</span> wide. It
was sub-elliptical in form, upper lip somewhat abruptly
compressed. The lower border was obtuse and
rounded. The dorsum was smooth, and presented at
its posterior edge a single sulcus placed midway between
the tip and the inferior border. The hilus extended
nearly the entire length of the under surface.</p>

<p class='c013'>2. <i>The livers</i> (Fig. <a href='#fig16'>16</a>).—In Eng the liver was 9 in.
broad. The right lobe was <span class="nowrap">7-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> in.</span> wide, antero-posteriorly.
The fundus of the gall-bladder was seen on the
anterior edge of the organ. The only noticeable feature
on the under surface of the liver, was the lobus
Spigelii. This was large, measuring 2 in. in transverse
diameter, and <span class="nowrap">2-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> in.</span> in antero-posterior diameter. It
presented a somewhat increased breadth of neck, which
was overlapped by an anterior prolongation of the lobe,
and terminated by a rounded compressed extremity at
the transverse fissure. The quadrilateral lobe was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>well developed, 2 in. long in greatest diameter, 10 lines

table <span class="nowrap">E. R.,</span> <span class="nowrap">C. L.,</span> the left kidney (Fig. <a href='#fig17'>17</a>, <span class='fss'>A</span>) was
4 in. long, <span class="nowrap">1-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> wide at its hilus, and of the usual kidney
shape. It lacked <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> in. of reaching the crest of the ilium.
The renal vein (Fig. <a href='#fig17'>17</a>, <span class='fss'>C</span>) of the same side measured
3 in. in length, and was decidedly oblique in
position, its termination in the cava being below the
level of the lower end of the kidney.</p>

<p class='c011'>The right kidney (Fig. <a href='#fig17'>17</a>, <span class='fss'>B</span>) corresponded in position
to the left kidney of Chang, that is to say, it was
in the shallower portion of the abdomen, and in contact
with the abdominal wall. It measured 4 in. in
length, and <span class="nowrap">2-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> in.</span> in width. Its inferior border lacked
2 in. of reaching the superior crest of the ilium. The
renal vein ascended a little upward to enter the cava
a little below the level of the upper end of the kidney.</p>

<p class='c011'>In Chang, the body lying in such a way that the
great trochanter of the right side rested on the table,
the left trochanter being raised three inches from the
same plane, an obliquity was given to the trunk, and
rendered the position of the abdominal organs somewhat
anomalous.</p>

<p class='c011'>The left kidney (Fig. <a href='#fig18'>18</a>, <span class='fss'>A</span>) lay with its lower
half clearly within the iliac fossa, its inferior border
answering to a point an inch and a half below the
termination of the aorta. The organ lay, at its inner
and inferior portion, upon the left primitive iliac vein;
it measured <span class="nowrap">3-<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> in.</span> in length, and <span class="nowrap">2-<sup>7</sup>/<sub>12</sub> in.</span> in width at its

<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>above, and was marked by the characteristic notch on
its inner side. The renal vein (Fig. <a href='#fig18'>18</a>, <span class='fss'>C</span>) was very
obliquely situated, indeed was almost parallel with the
cava, and was <span class="nowrap">3-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> in.</span> long. The termination of the renal
vein answered to a line running across the abdomen
lying fully 1 in. above the upper end of the left kidney.</p>

<p class='c011'>The right kidney (Fig. <a href='#fig18'>18</a>, <span class='fss'>B</span>) was normally situated.
It measured 4 in. in length, and <span class="nowrap">1-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> in.</span> in width at its
centre, and presented the usual reniform appearance.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Its inferior edge just reached an eminence answering
to the superior crest of the ilium.</p>

<p class='c013'>4. <i>The testicles.</i>—The right testicle of Eng was
normal. The left testicle was not within the scrotum.
Dissection from within the abdomen showed that the
organ had been retracted. It lay well concealed within
the inguinal canal, slight traction making it appear
within the abdomen.</p>

<p class='c011'>The testicles of Chang were normal.</p>

<p class='c013'>5. <i>The hearts.</i>—The heart in Eng was situated
nearer the median line than normal. The abdominal
incision was very unfavorable for studying its exact
position in the mediastinum. It was removed through
an opening made in the diaphragm. The right side of
the heart was occupied by a soft grumous clot much
smaller than was found in the same locality in Chang,
and which did not distend the cavities. The left side
was normal. It was without clot so far as could be
determined in the injected condition of the ventricle.</p>

<p class='c011'>The heart of Chang presented a right auricle and
ventricle distended with a dense venous clot; this
extended from the right ventricle along the pulmonary
arteries. The left side of the heart was empty.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale were firmly
closed in both hearts.</p>

<p class='c013'>6. <i>The vessels.</i>—The arteries of both subjects were,
so far as examined, in an extremely atheromatous condition.
Large plates of calcareous matter were deposited
in the abdominal aortas. The injecting matter
flowed insufficiently in the left lower extremity of
Chang, from a clot plugging the femoral artery.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>The venous system of Chang was engorged, giving
the appearance of these vessels having been injected
after death; that of Eng was comparatively empty.</p>

<p class='c013'>7. <i>The lungs.</i>—The lungs were so altered by <i>post-mortem</i>
changes prior to embalming, their contraction
by the chloride of zinc, and their increase of
weight from the plaster, that no extended examination
was made of them. But little difference was
seen between the conditions of the lungs in the two
men. No hepatization was present in Chang.</p>

<p class='c013'>8. <i>The vertebral column and ribs.</i>—There was
marked lateral curvature of the vertebral column in
both bodies. This was more conspicuous in Chang.
The convexity of the curve was about half-way down
the vertebral column, and inclined in Chang to the
right side. The distance from the centre of the vertebral
column to the left abdominal wall, 2 in.; to the
right abdominal wall, 5 in. The left side of the abdominal
cavity, measuring from about the level of the
band to the last rib of the right side, <span class="nowrap">7-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ribs in both Chang and Eng were 22 in number,
7 true and 4 false. On the right side of Eng the first,
second, and third ribs were normal. The fourth, fifth,
sixth, and seventh presented diminished intercostal
spaces, owing probably to the extreme traction made
on them by the deflection of the ensiform cartilages.
The intercostal space between the third and fourth
ribs was slightly contracted; that between the fourth
and fifth ribs was very much contracted, the muscle
being bulged inward. Between the fifth and sixth, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>sixth and seventh ribs the space was less contracted.
The remaining intercostal spaces were about normal.
The fifth rib near its articulation with the vertebral
column formed a well-defined ridge within the thorax,
carrying with it the sixth and seventh ribs, thus forming
a rounded elevation, distinguishing the positions of
these ribs from the thoracic wall above and below
this point, where the parietal surface presented the
usual concave appearance.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the left side of Chang a similar arrangement of
ribs and intercostal spaces was seen to the above.</p>

<p class='c011'>The remaining organs were not examined.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>REMARKS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>With reference to the cause of death of the Siamese
twins it may be briefly said that, in consequence of
the restrictions by which we were bound, no examination
of the brains was made. It cannot, therefore, be
proved that the cause of Chang’s death was a cerebral
clot, although such an opinion, from the suddenness
of death, preceded as it was by hemiplegia and an
immediate engorgement of the left lung, is tenable.
Eng died, in all probability, in a state of syncope
induced by fright—a view which the over-distended
bladder and the retraction of the right testicle would
appear to corroborate.</p>

<p class='c011'>The existence of lateral curvature was not unsuspected.
It was known to those who had examined the
twins before death. Indeed, it must have been a
necessity of the acquired position.</p>

<p class='c011'>The presence of a pad of subperitoneal fat at the
usual position of the umbilicus was certainly curious.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>It would appear to be an example of a localized nutritive
change about the peritoneum, at the centre of the
umbilical region, anticipating the exit of the vessels of
the cord at that point. Familiar examples of this anticipation
between structures developing from different
layers of the embryo are seen in malformations of the
genital organs, eye, ear, etc. In the above example it
is remarkable only from the rarity of the conditions
yielding it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The circulation in each individual of the twins was
practically complete, since the demonstration of continuity
between the portal systems, although satisfactory,
invites the conclusion that the amount of blood
which passed from one to the other side of the band
must have been, in the condition of the parts at the
time of the demonstration, very inconsiderable, and
was not competent in all probability to modify the
performance of any act of the economy.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the fœtal and early period of extra-uterine life the
vessels must have been more capacious, and associated
with a large tract of liver tissue. It follows, all things
being equal, that an attempt at division of the band
in early life would have been accompanied with more
venous hemorrhage than at any subsequent period.</p>

<p class='c011'>In proof that the twins were the product of a single
conception, the strict correspondence between the
markings of the two spleens, as well as the number of
the ribs, may be observed. The absence of available
data bearing upon the question of symmetry between
visceral organs of twins, prevents us from drawing
here too positive an inference. It is probable, however,
that the twins were individuals of a single organism,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>remarkable for its complete expression of duplex <span class="nowrap">bilaterality.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c010'><sup>[5]</sup></a></span></p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
